# machine_learning_R
This repo contains my first R codes ever!
ml_alphabet.R uses machine learning to classify letters that have been decomposed into small segments.  The data (alphabet.csv) was pulled from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a public database for data that can be used for machine learning projects.
